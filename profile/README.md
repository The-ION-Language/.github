# Hello there! Thanks for checking out The ION Language!

### What is the ION Language?
The ION Language is my attempt at making a custom programming language based (mostly) on Javascript. Why? Because ~~I hate myself~~ I want to learn more about how lexical parsers work and how compilers do what compilers do.

## Features
* C-Style forking (all variables and states copied over)
* A (mostly) complete packaging system with a built-in packager and installer!
* C-Style include statements (i.e. `#include "module_name"`)
* Robust and actually expressive error messages
* Support for many of Javascript's core features such as try/catch/throw, loops, conditionals, etc

## How to Install
Run: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ION606/ION-Lang/main/utils/install.sh)"`

## How to Run
Simply use `ion run {PATH_TO_ION_FILE}`


## How to Install/Remove Packages
Simply use `ion install {PACKAGE_NAME}` or `ion i {PACKAGE_NAME}`

Use `ion uninstall {PACKAGE_NAME}` or `ion u {PACKAGE_NAME}` to remove packages
